## General 

Proper nutrition, exercise, sunshine, rest and positive thinking. Pay attention to all of these, especially sunshine, rest and positive thinking.

> Exclude foods that have little or no nutrient value.

*Nutrient density per calorie* is the magic formula.  High nutrient density, high ANDI scores.

## Diet & Food Choices

*DO:* Green veggies, beans, nuts, low fructose fresh fruit, in order.  Periodic fasting is a brilliant way to improve gut -- and overall health.  Always drink plenty of water.  [Full food list with scores](http://www.drfuhrman.com/library/andi-food-scores.aspx)

*DON'T:* Animal foods are acid-forming: meat, dairy, and eggs.  These are bro-staples, but fail the nutrients per calorie test, and should be avoided.

Cereal grains, especially when refined (such as white wheat flour and white rice) are also acid-forming, and are worse than meat.  No salt, wheat (in all forms including wholegrain), or oils.

Omega 3 (DHA) up to 1000mg a day.

Sunlight: we need Vitamin D.
